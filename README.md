# MST Acute Exercise Project Analysis
This project is the final project of my dissertation and focussed on determining how an acute bout of aerobic exercise effects hippocampal subfield microstructure and function in healthy older adults. 

Specifically, we want to determine the effects of acute exercise on behavioral pattern separation called the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST - hippocampal subfield specific cognitive task), hippocampal fMRI activity while performing the MST in the scanner, and microstructure (using advances multishell diffusion imaging techniques).

stim_files 
- folder includes jupyter notebook scripts to modify MST behavioral output at the scanner to get stim timing files. 
- These are used in later fMRI analysis to model the BOLD-fMRI signal for different contrasts
